programmatically dumped from the Data class at runtime
(not done by brian151)

the main objective was to collect the uid values, as they incorrectly
decompiled to 'intitialvalue += 1' instead of 'inititialvalue++'

sorted_filtered has only the uids
sorted_unfiltered has everything
both are in alphabetical order
